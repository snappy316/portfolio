# Portfolio

This is the codebase for [github.com/snappy316](Davidâ€™s) portfolio site.

## Issues
There is currently an error somewhere in my Rakefile, but I'm too tired to figure out where. When running `rake test`, all tests pass. However, there is a weird `InvalidAuthenticityToken` error in the `delete_an_article_test` when running only `rake`.
